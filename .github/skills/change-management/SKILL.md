# Change Management Skill

> Patterns for organizational change, ADKAR methodology, stakeholder engagement, and adoption strategies.

## Change Management Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Best For |
| --------- | ----- | -------- |
| **ADKAR** | Individual change | Specific, measurable transitions |
| **Kotter's 8 Steps** | Organizational momentum | Large-scale transformation |
| **Lewin's 3 Stage** | Simple conceptual model | Teaching, small changes |
| **McKinsey 7S** | Organizational alignment | Strategic restructuring |
| **Bridges Transition** | Psychological transition | People-focused change |

## ADKAR Model Deep Dive

### The Five Elements

| Element | Question | Achieved When |
| ------- | -------- | ------------- |
| **A**wareness | Why is change needed? | Person understands business reasons |
| **D**esire | What's in it for me? | Person wants to participate |
| **K**nowledge | How do I change? | Person knows what to do |
| **A**bility | Can I do it? | Person can demonstrate new skills |
| **R**einforcement | Will it stick? | Systems sustain the change |

### ADKAR Assessment Template

```text
Rate 1-5 for each stakeholder group:

Awareness:     [ ] Do they understand WHY?
Desire:        [ ] Do they WANT to change?
Knowledge:     [ ] Do they know HOW?
Ability:       [ ] Can they DO it?
Reinforcement: [ ] Will it STICK?

Barrier Point: First element scoring ≤ 3
Action Focus:  Address barrier point first
```

### Barrier Point Actions

| Barrier | Tactics |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Awareness** | Communications, business case, impact stories |
| **Desire** | WIIFM, sponsor engagement, peer advocacy |
| **Knowledge** | Training, job aids, documentation |
| **Ability** | Practice, coaching, support resources |
| **Reinforcement** | Recognition, metrics, accountability |

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Power/Interest Grid

```text
High Power  │ Keep Satisfied │ Manage Closely │
            │                │                │
Low Power   │ Monitor        │ Keep Informed  │
            └────────────────┴────────────────┘
              Low Interest     High Interest
```

### Stakeholder Mapping Template

| Stakeholder | Impact | Influence | Current State | Target State | Strategy |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| [Name/Group] | H/M/L | H/M/L | Supportive/Neutral/Resistant | Advocate/Supportive | [Actions] |

### Influence Strategies by Quadrant

| Quadrant | Strategy |
| -------- | -------- |
| High Power, High Interest | Engage deeply, involve in decisions |
| High Power, Low Interest | Keep satisfied, don't overwhelm |
| Low Power, High Interest | Keep informed, leverage as advocates |
| Low Power, Low Interest | Monitor, minimal effort |

## Resistance Management

### Types of Resistance

| Type | Signs | Root Cause |
| ---- | ----- | ---------- |
| **Active** | Vocal opposition, sabotage | Strong disagreement |
| **Passive** | Slow compliance, "forgetting" | Low desire or ability |
| **Hidden** | Surface agreement, no action | Fear or distrust |

### Resistance Root Causes

- **Loss** — Status, comfort, competence, relationships
- **Fear** — Unknown, failure, looking incompetent
- **Distrust** — Past failures, leadership credibility
- **Disagreement** — Believe current way is better
- **Overload** — Too many changes, not enough capacity

### Response Strategies

| Cause | Response |
| ----- | -------- |
| Loss | Acknowledge, involve in design |
| Fear | Provide safety, support, training |
| Distrust | Transparent communication, quick wins |
| Disagreement | Listen, incorporate feedback, explain |
| Overload | Prioritize, phase, resource |

## Communication Planning

### ADKAR-Aligned Messages

| Phase | Key Messages |
| ----- | ------------ |
| **Awareness** | Why change, what's happening, timeline |
| **Desire** | Benefits, WIIFM, success stories |
| **Knowledge** | How-to, resources, training schedule |
| **Ability** | Support available, practice opportunities |
| **Reinforcement** | Progress updates, recognition, results |

### Channel Selection

| Channel | Best For |
| ------- | -------- |
| Executive video | Awareness, importance |
| Town halls | Q&A, two-way dialogue |
| Email | Reference information |
| Team meetings | Local context, discussion |
| Champions | Peer influence, support |
| Intranet | Self-service resources |

### Communication Frequency by Phase

| Phase | Frequency |
| ----- | --------- |
| Pre-launch | Weekly builds to daily |
| Launch | Daily to multiple per day |
| Post-launch | Daily decreasing to weekly |
| Sustain | Periodic reinforcement |

## Sponsor Engagement

### Effective Sponsor Actions

- Communicate directly (not just through project team)
- Visible participation in key events
- Remove obstacles and allocate resources
- Recognize and reward adoption
- Hold people accountable
- Model the change personally

### Sponsor Coaching Topics

| Topic | Key Points |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Role clarity | Active vs. passive sponsorship |
| Time investment | 10-20% of time during change |
| Communication | Authentic, frequent, cascaded |
| Resistance | Personal conversations with resistors |
| Coalition | Building peer sponsor network |

## Training & Support Design

### Knowledge Transfer Methods

| Method | Best For |
| ------ | -------- |
| Instructor-led | Complex, interactive skills |
| E-learning | Basic, self-paced, compliance |
| Job aids | Quick reference, procedures |
| Coaching | Individual skill development |
| Peer learning | Practical tips, ongoing support |
| Sandbox/practice | Safe experimentation |

### Support Structure

```text
Tier 1: Self-service (docs, FAQs, videos)
    ↓
Tier 2: Floor support (champions, super users)
    ↓
Tier 3: Help desk (technical issues)
    ↓
Tier 4: Specialists (complex problems)
```

## Measuring Change Success

### Leading Indicators

- Training completion rates
- Communication reach/engagement
- Stakeholder sentiment surveys
- Champion activity levels
- Support ticket themes

### Lagging Indicators

- Adoption/utilization metrics
- Proficiency assessments
- Process compliance
- Business outcomes
- Employee satisfaction

### ADKAR Metrics

| Element | Metric Examples |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Awareness | Survey: "Do you understand why?" |
| Desire | Survey: "Do you support this change?" |
| Knowledge | Assessment scores, training completion |
| Ability | Proficiency demonstration, error rates |
| Reinforcement | Sustained metrics, audit results |

## Change Saturation

### Capacity Assessment

- Count concurrent changes per person/team
- Assess cumulative impact
- Identify change collisions
- Recommend sequencing/phasing

### Saturation Warning Signs

- Increased resistance to any change
- "Change fatigue" language
- Declining engagement
- Quality/productivity drops
- Increased turnover

## Synapses

- [knowledge-synthesis] (Medium, Uses, Forward) — "Stakeholder feedback synthesis"
- [appropriate-reliance] (Medium, Applies, Forward) — "Trust in change leadership"

### Supporting Connections
