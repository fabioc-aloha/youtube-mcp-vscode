## Core Frameworks

### Erin Meyer's 8 Cultural Scales

| Scale | Low-Context (US/Germanic) | High-Context (Asia/Latin) |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Communicating** | Explicit, direct | Implicit, reads between lines |
| **Evaluating** | Direct negative feedback | Wrapped, indirect criticism |
| **Persuading** | Applications-first | Principles-first |
| **Leading** | Egalitarian | Hierarchical |
| **Deciding** | Consensual or top-down | Top-down with face-saving |
| **Trusting** | Task-based | Relationship-based |
| **Disagreeing** | Confrontational OK | Avoids confrontation |
| **Scheduling** | Linear time | Flexible time |

### Hofstede Cultural Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | High (70+) | Low (30-) |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Power Distance** | Acceptance of hierarchy | India (77), Brazil (69) | US (40), Germany (35) |
| **Individualism** | Individual vs group focus | US (91), UK (89) | Colombia (13), Brazil (38) |
| **Uncertainty Avoidance** | Need for structure | Colombia (80), Brazil (76) | India (40), US (46) |
| **Long-Term Orientation** | Future vs present focus | Germany (83), India (51) | Colombia (13), US (26) |

## Communication Adaptation

### Direct → Indirect Translation Table

| Direct Style (US) | Indirect Style (India/LatAm) | Actual Meaning |
|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| "No, that won't work" | "That could be challenging" | Blocker |
| "I'm stuck" | "I'm still working on it" | Help needed |
| "This deadline is unrealistic" | "We'll try our best" | Won't happen |
| "I disagree" | Silence or vague agreement | Disagreement |

### Decoding High-Context Responses

When team members from high-context cultures say:
- **"We'll try"** → May already know it won't happen
- **"It's almost done"** → Could mean 20% or 80% complete
- **Silence on a question** → May indicate disagreement or confusion
- **"Yes, understood"** → May mean "I heard you" not "I agree"

### Questions That Create Safety

| Instead of... | Try... | Why It Works |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| "Are you blocked?" | "What obstacles are you facing?" | Normalizes obstacles |
| "Will this be done by Friday?" | "What's your realistic completion estimate?" | Permission for honesty |
| "Any questions?" | "What would you like me to clarify?" | Assumes need is normal |
| "Is this clear?" | "Walk me through your understanding" | Tests without yes/no trap |
| "Can you do this?" | "What resources would help you succeed?" | Support framing |
| "Why is this late?" | "What happened that we should learn from?" | Process focus, not blame |

---

## The "Yes" Culture (High Power Distance)

### Why "No" Is Difficult

In high Power Distance cultures (India = 77, Brazil = 69), saying "no" to superiors:
- Feels disrespectful
- Implies inability or incompetence
- Damages the relationship
- Reflects poorly on one's team

### Signs of Hidden Blockers

| Observable Behavior | Possible Hidden Meaning |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| ADO item stays "New" for days | Unsure how to start, waiting for guidance |
| Commits happening but no status updates | Focused on delivery, avoiding overhead |
| Vague standup updates | Uncertain, avoiding specifics |
| Last-minute delivery | Struggled throughout but didn't escalate |
| "Almost done" for multiple days | Blocked but saving face |

### Creating Psychological Safety

Model statement to normalize blockers:

> "I'd rather know about a problem on Day 1 than be surprised on Day 14. Raising blockers early is a sign of professionalism, not weakness. It helps me help you."

**Techniques:**
1. **Normalize blockers**: "Every complex project has blockers. I expect them."
2. **Reward early escalation**: Publicly praise when someone raises an issue early
3. **Separate person from problem**: "The process isn't working" not "You're not working"
4. **Ask permission-giving questions**: "What would help you move faster?"
5. **Model vulnerability**: Share your own blockers in standups
6. **Create private channels**: 1:1s feel safer for raising concerns

## Hierarchy-Aware Communication

### Working With Team Leads

In high Power Distance cultures, team members:
- May not act until their lead explicitly directs them
- Will prioritize their lead's requests over documented processes
- Need lead's permission to push back or escalate
- Look to lead for interpretation of requirements

| Your Assumption | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "I told the team to update ADO" | They're waiting for lead to reinforce it |
| "The process doc is clear" | They need lead to operationalize it |
| "Anyone can escalate to me" | They'll only escalate through lead |

### Empowering Through Hierarchy

1. **Empower lead explicitly**: "You have full authority to enforce this"
2. **Channel through lead**: Ask lead to cascade messages
3. **Include lead in decisions**: Even small ones reinforce authority
4. **Give lead escalation tools**: Pre-written messages to use with team
5. **Never undercut lead publicly**: Feedback privately, support publicly

---

## Feedback Across Cultures

### The Sandwich Problem

Americans often sandwich criticism: "Great work on X, but Y needs improvement, and Z was excellent."

**Problem**: High-context cultures may only hear the positives.

| Feedback | American Meaning | High-Context Interpretation |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| "This needs work" | Needs improvement | Strong criticism, possibly career-threatening |
| "Pretty good" | Mediocre | Positive feedback |
| "Interesting approach" | Skeptical | Genuine interest |
| "Let's discuss offline" | Need to resolve issue | Face saved, private criticism coming |

### Best Practice for Cross-Cultural Feedback

1. **Private first**: Give critical feedback in 1:1s, never group settings
2. **Be explicit**: "I need you to change X specifically" not "Maybe consider..."
3. **Confirm understanding**: Ask them to restate what they'll do differently
4. **Follow up in writing**: Document the feedback and expected changes
5. **Route through lead**: For sensitive issues, let lead deliver feedback appropriately

## Trust Building

### Task-Based vs. Relationship-Based

| Trust Style | How Trust Is Built | Time Required | Cultures |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Task-Based** | Deliver results | Fast | US, Germany, UK |
| **Relationship-Based** | Personal connection | Slow | India, Brazil, Colombia, Japan |

**Implication**: Task-oriented cultures want to dive into work immediately. Relationship-oriented cultures need connection first—or they'll comply without truly engaging.

### Trust-Building Actions

| Action | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Learn and use names correctly | Shows respect; pronunciation matters |
| Ask about cultural holidays (Diwali, Holi, Carnaval) | Cultural awareness builds connection |
| Start calls with 2 min of personal chat | Relationship before task |
| Acknowledge their late hours publicly | Shows appreciation, builds loyalty |
| Share your own challenges and failures | Models vulnerability |
| Celebrate wins publicly, credit specifically | Recognition matters in collectivist cultures |
| Remember personal details | "How's your son's exams?" shows caring |

### Trust-Eroding Actions to Avoid

| Action | Why It's Harmful |
|--------|------------------|
| Criticizing in group settings | Public shame is devastating |
| Skipping lead to talk directly to team | Undermines authority, signals distrust |
| Last-minute deadline changes | Creates chaos, shows disrespect |
| Ignoring input after asking for it | Signals views don't matter |
| All-business, no relationship | Feels transactional, limits engagement |
| Assuming silence = agreement | Missing real concerns |

---

## Time Zone Collaboration

### Async-First Principles

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Async-first communication | Reduces late-night calls |
| Record key meetings | Watch during their hours |
| Standup via Teams/Slack post | No live meeting needed |
| Batch your questions | One email > multiple pings |
| Respect their mornings | Your early AM = their working hours |

### US ↔ India Optimal Windows

| US East (EST) | India (IST) | Best For |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| 6:00-8:00 AM | 4:30-6:30 PM | Live collaboration |
| 9:00-10:00 AM | 7:30-8:30 PM | Quick syncs (limit 30 min) |

**Warning Signs of Burnout:**
- Regular late-night work
- "Just get it done" mentality
- Family time sacrificed
- Meeting fatigue

## Escalation — Culturally Calibrated

### L1: Team Channel Ask

**Before**: "Hey team, ADO-6132 needs an update. Please update by EOD."

**After**: "Hi team, I noticed ADO-6132 hasn't been updated recently. This helps me report accurate status to leadership. [Lead], can you check in with the assigned dev and help them update? Thanks!"

*Routes through lead, explains purpose, frames as help not demand.*

### L2: Direct Message

**Before**: "This item is stalled. Update immediately or escalate the blocker."

**After**: "Hi [Lead], I want to make sure the team isn't struggling silently on ADO-6132. Can you check if there are any obstacles? I'm here to help remove blockers. Let's make sure ADO reflects reality so we can support the team properly."

*Assumes good intent, positions as helper, focuses on support.*

## Key Cultural Holidays

### India (Plan for reduced capacity)

| Holiday | Typical Timing | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Diwali** | Oct-Nov | Biggest holiday — expect low productivity 1 week |
| **Holi** | March | Festival of colors, 1-2 days |
| **Dussehra** | October | 1-2 day festival |
| **Independence Day** | August 15 | National holiday |

### Latin America

| Holiday | Typical Timing | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Carnaval** | February | Major in Brazil (4-5 days) |
| **Semana Santa** | March-April | Holy Week |
| **Christmas Eve** | December 24 | Often more important than Dec 25 |

**Cross-Cultural Tip**: Wishing team members well on their holidays builds relationship trust.
