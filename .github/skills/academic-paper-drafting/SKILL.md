# Academic Paper Drafting Skill

> Turn research into published scholarship. From blank page to accepted manuscript.

This skill provides structured workflows for drafting academic papers, with venue-specific guidance for HCI conferences (CHI), business publications (HBR), and academic journals (Cognitive Systems Research, Minds & Machines).

## Drafting Philosophy

### The Academic Writing Paradox

| Challenge | Reality | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| "I need to read more first" | Reading is procrastination | Write to discover what you don't know |
| "I need the perfect first sentence" | First drafts are meant to be bad | Start with the section you know best |
| "I'll write when I have time" | Time expands to fill available space | Write in focused sprints |
| "It needs to be original" | Synthesis is originality | Combine existing ideas in new ways |

### The Write-to-Think Method

```
Messy Draft → Clarity → Structure → Polish → Submit
     ↑                                    ↓
     └────── Reviewer Feedback ───────────┘
```

**Key insight**: Writing IS thinking. You don't figure out your argument first and then write it — you figure it out BY writing it.

### CHI Contribution Types

CHI values explicit contribution statements. Choose your type:

| Type | Description | Evidence Needed |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Empirical** | New knowledge about people/technology | User study, data |
| **Artifact** | Novel system, tool, or interaction | Implementation, evaluation |

| State contribution type explicitly | Assume readers will infer |
| Include representative figures | Over-rely on text |
| Acknowledge limitations early | Hide weaknesses |
| Cite recent CHI papers | Ignore venue norms |

### HBR Writing Style

| Academic Style | HBR Style |
|----------------|-----------|
| "The study found that..." | "When we surveyed 300 executives..." |
| "Participants reported..." | "One CEO told us..." |
| "Hypothesis 1 was supported" | "The data confirms what many leaders suspect:" |
| "Implications include..." | "Here's what this means for your organization:" |
| Passive voice | Active, direct voice |
| Citations in text | Minimal citations, conversational |

### HBR Submission Tips

1. **Pitch first** — HBR prefers pitches before full drafts
2. **Lead with "What's new"** — Why now? What's changed?
3. **Name your framework** — Memorable concepts spread (e.g., "The Innovator's Dilemma")
4. **Include real companies** — Anonymized is OK, but real examples work better
5. **Write for the airport** — Busy executive on a flight should get value

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 weeks)

| Step | Output |
|------|--------|
| Literature immersion | Annotated bibliography |
| Gap identification | 2-3 sentence gap statement |
| Contribution clarity | Explicit contribution list |
| Outline creation | Section-by-section plan |
| Figure sketches | Hand-drawn or rough diagrams |

### Phase 2: Rough Draft (1-2 weeks)

**Rules for first draft:**
1. **Don't edit while writing** — Separate generation from editing
2. **Start with what you know** — Often Methods or Results, not Intro
3. **Use placeholder brackets** — "[CITE Smith here]", "[need better transition]"
4. **Aim for "shitty first draft"** — Anne Lamott's term; embrace imperfection

### Phase 3: Revision (1-2 weeks)

| Level | Focus | Questions to Ask |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Structure** | Overall argument | Does it flow logically? |
| **Section** | Each section's job | Does this section earn its place? |
| **Paragraph** | One idea per paragraph | What's the topic sentence? |
| **Sentence** | Clarity, precision | Can this be simpler? |
| **Word** | Precision, concision | Is this the right word? |

### Phase 4: Feedback (2-4 weeks)

| Feedback Source | What to Ask |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Advisor** | Is the argument sound? Scope appropriate? |
| **Peer in field** | Is this interesting? What's missing? |
| **Peer outside field** | Is this clear? What's confusing? |
| **Writing group** | How's the prose? What drags? |

### Phase 5: Polish & Submit

- [ ] Format per venue requirements
- [ ] Check word/page count
- [ ] Verify all citations
- [ ] Anonymize if required
- [ ] Test figure readability at print size
- [ ] Submit before deadline (not AT deadline)

---

## Citation Integration

### Weaving Citations Naturally

| Pattern | Example | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Narrative** | "Smith (2024) argues that..." | Discussing specific work |
| **Parenthetical** | "...has been demonstrated (Smith, 2024)" | Supporting a general claim |
| **Integrated** | "Smith's (2024) framework suggests..." | Referencing framework/concept |
| **Multiple** | "...is well-established (Smith, 2024; Jones, 2023)" | Broad support |

### How Many Citations?

| Section | Citation Density |
|---------|------------------|
| Abstract | 0 (usually) |
| Introduction | Medium (establish context) |
| Related Work | High (comprehensive review) |
| Methods | Low-Medium (justify choices) |
| Results | Low (your data, not others') |
| Discussion | Medium (connect to literature) |

---

## Handling Rejection

### Reviewer Response Framework

| Reviewer Says | What It Means | Response Strategy |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Missing related work" | Gap in literature coverage | Add citations, explain positioning |
| "Claims not supported" | Evidence insufficient | Add data or soften claim |
| "Unclear methodology" | Can't assess validity | Expand method description |
| "Contribution unclear" | Buried or vague value | Make contribution explicit in intro |
| "Writing needs work" | Surface issues distract | Get editing help, revise prose |
| "Not right for venue" | Mismatch with audience | Try different venue, reframe |
