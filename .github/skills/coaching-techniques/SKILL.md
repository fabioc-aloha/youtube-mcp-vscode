## Overview

Coaching develops people's capability rather than directing their actions. Effective coaching unlocks potential, builds ownership, and creates sustainable performance improvement.

### Coaching vs. Other Approaches

| Approach | When to Use | Leader's Role |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Telling** | Crisis, safety, no time | Expert, director |
| **Teaching** | Skill gap, new domain | Instructor |
| **Mentoring** | Career development | Sharing experience |
| **Coaching** | Capability exists, needs unlocking | Partner, facilitator |

### The Core Principle

> **Ask, don't tell. The coachee holds the answers; your job is to help them find those answers.**

## Module 1: The GROW Model

### Framework Overview

|-------|---------|---------------|
| **G**oal | Clarify desired outcome | "What do you want to achieve?" |
| **R**eality | Explore current situation | "Where are you now?" |
| **O**ptions | Generate possibilities | "What could you do?" |
| **W**ill | Commit to action | "What will you do?" |

### Goal Phase Questions

- "What would you like to focus on today?"
- "What outcome do you want from this conversation?"
- "How will you know you've achieved it?"
- "Why is this important to you now?"
- "What would success look like?"

### Reality Phase Questions

- "What's happening currently?"
- "What have you tried so far?"
- "What's working? What isn't?"
- "What obstacles are in the way?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, where are you now?"
- "What resources do you already have?"

### Options Phase Questions

- "What options do you see?"
- "What else could you do?"
- "If you had unlimited resources, what would you try?"
- "What would you advise a friend in this situation?"
- "What's the opposite approach?"
- "Which options appeal to you most?"

### Will Phase Questions

## Module 2: Active Listening

### The Three Levels of Listening

| Level | Focus | Quality |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **1. Internal** | Your own thoughts, reactions | Minimal presence |
| **2. Focused** | The speaker's words, emotions | Good coaching |
| **3. Global** | Energy, unspoken, environment | Masterful coaching |

### Active Listening Techniques

| Technique | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Paraphrasing** | Confirm understanding | "So you're saying..." |
| **Reflecting feeling** | Acknowledge emotion | "It sounds frustrating that..." |
| **Summarizing** | Consolidate key points | "The main issues are X, Y, Z" |
| **Clarifying** | Ensure precision | "When you say X, what do you mean?" |
| **Silence** | Create space | *Pause, wait* |

### Non-Verbal Awareness

| Signal | What It May Mean |
|--------|------------------|
| Eye contact breaks | Discomfort, thinking |
| Changed breathing | Emotion, stress |
| Posture shift | Engagement change |
| Voice tone shift | Emotional content |
| Fidgeting | Anxiety, boredom |

### Listening Blockers

| Blocker | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Advising | Removes ownership | Ask what they think |
| Interrupting | Shuts down exploration | Wait, summarize |
| Evaluating | Kills candor | Stay neutral |
| Problem-solving | Takes over | Ask for their solution |

---

## Module 3: Powerful Questions

### Question Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Open-ended** | Can't be answered yes/no |
| **Curious** | Genuinely explore, not lead |
| **Simple** | One question at a time |
| **Forward-focused** | Action-oriented when appropriate |

### Question Types

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Clarifying** | Understand better | "What do you mean by...?" |
| **Deepening** | Explore further | "What's behind that?" |
| **Challenging** | Test assumptions | "What if that's not true?" |
| **Possibility** | Open up options | "What else might work?" |
| **Action** | Move to commitment | "What's your next step?" |

### Questions to Avoid

| Question Type | Problem | Better Version |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| "Why did you...?" | Feels judgmental | "What led to that decision?" |
| "Have you tried X?" | Leading/advising | "What have you considered?" |
| "Don't you think...?" | Puts words in mouth | "What do you think?" |
| Multiple questions | Confusing | One question, wait |

## Module 4: Feedback for Development

### The SBI Model

| Element | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **S**ituation | When and where | "In yesterday's team meeting..." |
| **B**ehavior | Observable action | "...when you interrupted Sarah..." |
| **I**mpact | Effect on you/others | "...the team seemed reluctant to share after that" |

### Feedforward (Marshall Goldsmith)

Instead of critiquing the past, suggest for the future:

1. Pick one behavior to improve
2. Ask for suggestions (not feedback)
3. Listen without defending
4. Thank without evaluating

**Example**: "I want to be better at running inclusive meetings. What one suggestion do you have?"

### Receiving Feedback

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Listen** | Don't interrupt or defend |
| **Clarify** | Ask for examples if needed |
| **Thank** | Appreciate the effort |
| **Reflect** | Consider validity privately |
| **Act** | Make visible improvements |

### Praise Effectively

| Weak Praise | Strong Praise |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Good job" | "The way you handled that objection showed real preparation" |
| "You're smart" | "Your analysis surfaced issues nobody else caught" |
| Generic | Specific behavior + impact |

## Module 5: Coaching Difficult Moments

### When Coachee is Stuck

| Symptom | Intervention |
|---------|--------------|
| "I don't know" | "If you did know, what might it be?" |
| Going in circles | "Let's step back—what's the real issue?" |
| Avoidance | "What are you not saying?" |
| Overwhelm | "What's the smallest first step?" |

### Resistance Patterns

| Pattern | Possible Cause | Response |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| Deflecting | Fear of accountability | Gently redirect |
| Intellectualizing | Avoiding emotion | "How do you feel about that?" |
| Blaming others | Avoiding ownership | "What's your part in this?" |
| Pessimism | Learned helplessness | Focus on what IS in control |

### When Coaching Isn't Appropriate

| Situation | Better Approach |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Performance crisis | Direct feedback, clear expectations |
| Skill gap (unknown) | Teaching, training |
| Values misalignment | Honest conversation about fit |
| Unwilling coachee | Don't force it |
