## Overview

Executives make decisions in minutes, not hours. This skill transforms complex data and analysis into compelling narratives that drive action. The goal isn't to present information—it's to **influence outcomes**.

### Core Principle

> **Data tells. Stories sell.**

Executives don't need more data—they need clarity, confidence, and a clear path forward.

---

## Module 1: The Executive Mindset

### What Executives Care About

| Priority | Questions They Ask |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Impact** | "What's the bottom line?" "How big is this?" |
| **Risk** | "What could go wrong?" "What's the downside?" |
| **Time** | "When will we see results?" "How long until ROI?" |
| **Resources** | "What do you need?" "What's the investment?" |
| **Decision** | "What do you want me to do?" "What's the ask?" |

### The Executive Attention Span

| Time | What They Absorb |
|------|------------------|
| **30 seconds** | Your main point (or they tune out) |
| **2 minutes** | Key supporting evidence |
| **5 minutes** | Nuances and Q&A prep |
| **15+ minutes** | Only if deeply engaged |

**Implication**: Lead with the conclusion, not the journey.

---

## Module 2: The SCQA Framework

Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle adapted for executive communication:

### Structure

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **S**ituation | Establish shared context | "Our AI adoption is below industry benchmarks." |
| **C**omplication | Introduce the tension | "Without intervention, we risk falling further behind." |
| **Q**uestion | The problem to solve | "How do we accelerate AI adoption?" |
| **A**nswer | Your recommendation | "Implement AIRS-based readiness assessment before deployment." |

### Example: AIRS Research Pitch

**Situation**: "Organizations are investing heavily in AI tools, but adoption rates remain inconsistent."

**Complication**: "We don't know which employees will adopt and which will resist—leading to failed rollouts and wasted investment."

**Question**: "How can we predict and optimize AI adoption before deployment?"

**Answer**: "AIRS-16, a validated psychometric instrument, predicts adoption intention with high accuracy. Price Value (β=.505) is the strongest driver—meaning ROI clarity is more important than trust or ease of use."

---

## Module 3: The Pyramid Principle

### Top-Down Communication

```
        [Main Point]
       /     |      \
  [Support] [Support] [Support]
   /  \      |   \      /  \
[Data][Data][Data][Data][Data][Data]
```

**Rule**: Always state the conclusion first, then provide supporting evidence.

### The "So What?" Test

For every claim, ask: "So what? Why does this matter to the executive?"

❌ **Weak**: "AIRS has 16 items measuring 8 constructs."
✅ **Strong**: "AIRS predicts adoption in 3 minutes—faster than any alternative."

❌ **Weak**: "Price Value had β=.505 in our analysis."
✅ **Strong**: "ROI clarity matters twice as much as any other factor—if you can't show the value, adoption will fail."

### Grouping and Ordering

**MECE Principle** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive):
- Groups should not overlap
- Groups should cover everything

**Ordering options:**
1. **Importance** - Most impactful first
2. **Time** - Chronological sequence
3. **Structure** - Parts of a whole
4. **Priority** - Ranked by urgency

---

## Module 4: Data Storytelling

### The Three Acts

| Act | Purpose | Content |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **Setup** | Context and stakes | Why this matters now |
| **Conflict** | The problem/challenge | What's broken, what's at risk |
| **Resolution** | Your solution | What to do, expected outcomes |

### Narrative Patterns

**The Hero's Journey** (for transformation stories):
- Current state (ordinary world)
- Challenge arises (call to adventure)
- Struggle and learning (trials)
- Success achieved (return with elixir)

**The Discovery** (for research findings):
- What we believed
- What we found
- What this changes

**The Comparison** (for recommendations):
- Option A: status quo
- Option B: alternative
- Why B wins

### Data Visualization Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **One point per chart** | Don't overload visuals |
| **Title is the takeaway** | "Revenue grew 40%" not "Revenue 2020-2025" |
| **Remove clutter** | No 3D, no gridlines, minimal legend |
| **Highlight the insight** | Color/size to draw eye to key data |

### Numbers That Stick

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Anchoring** | "That's 50% more than last year" |
| **Humanizing** | "Each hour saved equals 2,000 employees × $50/hr = $100K/year" |
| **Comparison** | "The cost of a coffee per employee per day" |
| **Rounding** | "$2.3M" not "$2,347,891.23" |

---

## Module 5: The Ask

### Clarity of Request

Every executive presentation needs a clear ask:

| Ask Type | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Decision** | "Approve the $500K investment" |
| **Input** | "Share your concerns so we can address them" |
| **Resource** | "Allocate 3 FTEs for 6 months" |
| **Alignment** | "Confirm this direction before we proceed" |
| **Escalation** | "Remove the blocker with [stakeholder]" |

### The One-Page Summary

| Section | Content | Lines |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Headline** | Main recommendation | 1 |
| **Context** | Why now, what's at stake | 2-3 |
| **Key findings** | 3 bullets maximum | 3-4 |
| **Recommendation** | Specific action | 2-3 |
| **Ask** | What you need from them | 1-2 |
| **Next steps** | Immediate actions | 2-3 |

---

## Module 6: Objection Handling

### Anticipate and Preempt

| Objection Type | Preemption Strategy |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Cost** | Lead with ROI, payback period |
| **Risk** | Acknowledge, present mitigations |
| **Timing** | Show urgency cost of delay |
| **Complexity** | Simplify, offer phased approach |
| **Skepticism** | Cite precedent, pilot results |

### The Acknowledge-Bridge-Response Pattern

1. **Acknowledge**: "That's a fair concern..."
2. **Bridge**: "What we've found is..."
3. **Response**: "...which is why we recommend..."

### Backup Slides

Keep supporting detail in backup slides:
- Detailed methodology
- Full data tables
- Alternative scenarios
- Risk registers
- Implementation timelines

## Templates

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch

```
We need to [action] because [problem].
Our approach is [solution].
This will deliver [outcome] within [timeframe].
I need [ask] to proceed.
```

### 5-Minute Executive Brief

```
1. [0:30] The headline and ask
2. [1:00] Context and stakes
3. [2:00] Evidence (3 key points)
4. [1:00] Recommendation details
5. [0:30] Specific ask and next steps
```

## Stakeholder Management

### The Power-Interest Grid

| | Low Interest | High Interest |
|--|--------------|---------------|
| **High Power** | Keep Satisfied | Manage Closely |
| **Low Power** | Monitor | Keep Informed |

### Stakeholder Profile Template

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Name/Role** | Who they are |
| **Power Level** | Decision authority |
| **Current Position** | Support, oppose, neutral |
| **Desired Position** | Where you need them |
| **Key Concerns** | What they worry about |
| **Motivators** | What they care about |
| **Communication Preference** | How to reach them |
| **Strategy** | How to move them |

### Influence Without Authority

| Strategy | When to Use | Tactics |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Reciprocity** | Building long-term allies | Do favors first, bank goodwill |
| **Coalition** | Facing resistance | Build supporter network |
| **Evidence** | Skeptical stakeholders | Data, pilots, proof points |
| **Authority** | Borrowed credibility | Executive sponsor, expert endorsement |
| **Social proof** | Risk-averse stakeholders | Industry examples, peer adoption |

### The Stakeholder Ladder

```
Opponent → Skeptic → Neutral → Supporter → Champion
```

### Resistance Patterns

| Resistance Type | Root Cause | Counter |
|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **Fear of unknown** | Uncertainty | Education, pilots |
| **Loss of power** | Territory threat | Involvement, shared credit |
| **Resource concern** | Budget/time | Clear scope, trade-offs |
| **Not invented here** | Pride | Co-creation, acknowledgment |

### Stakeholder Communication Frequency

| **Keep informed** | Monthly | Newsletters, dashboards |

### RACI Matrix

| Role | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **R**esponsible | Does the work |
| **A**ccountable | Owns the decision (one per task) |
| **C**onsulted | Input before decision |
| **I**nformed | Told after decision |

## Meeting Efficiency

### Meeting or Not?

| Need | Meeting Required? | Alternative |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Decide something | Maybe | Async decision doc if simple |
| Share information | Rarely | Email, video, document |
| Brainstorm | Often | Async + sync hybrid |
| Build relationships | Yes | No substitute for presence |
| Status updates | No | Dashboards, async standup |

### Meeting Types

| Type | Purpose | Duration | Required Elements |
|------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| **Decision** | Make a call | 30-60 min | Options, criteria, decider |
| **Creative** | Generate ideas | 60-90 min | Prompt, diverge/converge |
| **Tactical** | Coordinate action | 15-30 min | Blockers, handoffs |
| **Strategic** | Set direction | 60-120 min | Context, options, trade-offs |
| **1:1** | Develop people | 30-60 min | Their agenda first |

### Agenda Template

```markdown
## Meeting: [Purpose Statement]
**Duration**: [X min] | **Attendees**: [Required], [Optional]

### Pre-Work
- [ ] Review [document]

### Agenda
1. [Topic 1] - [Owner] - [Time] min
2. [Topic 2] - [Owner] - [Time] min

### Decisions Made
1. 

### Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due |
|--------|-------|-----|
```

### Facilitation Techniques

| Problem | Intervention |
|---------|--------------|
| One person dominates | "Let's hear from others" |
| Nobody speaks | Direct: "Sarah, your thoughts?" |
| Tangent emerges | "Interesting—let's park that" |
| Going in circles | "Let me summarize where we are" |
| Conflict emerges | "What do we actually agree on?" |

### Decision-Making Methods

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Consent** | Routine decisions ("Any objections?") |
| **Consensus** | High-stakes, need buy-in |
| **Consultative** | Need input, one decider |
| **Delegation** | Trust exists |

### Async Alternatives

| Meeting Type | Async Alternative |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Daily standup | Slack standup post |
| Weekly status | Dashboard + async digest |
| All-hands | Recorded video + AMA thread |
| Document review | Comments in doc |

### Meeting Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| No agenda | Require agenda for all meetings |
| Too many attendees | 7 ± 2 rule |
| Status meetings | Make async |
| No decisions | Clear decision process |
| No notes | Assign note-taker |
