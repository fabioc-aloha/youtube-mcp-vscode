## Presentation Structure

### The 20-Minute Defense Presentation

| Segment | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Opening Hook** | 1 min | Why this matters — the problem you solved |
| **Research Questions** | 2 min | The specific questions you addressed |
| **Literature Context** | 3 min | Key frameworks, identified gap |
| **Methodology** | 4 min | Design, sample, analysis approach |

### Slide Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **One idea per slide** | Title = the insight, not the topic |
| **Visual > Text** | Diagrams, charts, frameworks |
| **Maximum 5 bullets** | If more, split the slide |
| **Consistent design** | University template if provided |
| **Backup slides** | Detailed tables, extra analyses |

### Opening Statement Template

> "Thank you for this opportunity. Over the past [X years], I've investigated [research topic] because [motivation]. My research asked [RQ1], [RQ2], and [RQ3]. Using [methodology] with [sample size] participants, I found [headline finding]. This contributes to [field] by [novel contribution]. In the next 20 minutes, I'll walk you through my journey and findings."

### Closing Statement Template

> "In conclusion, this research contributes [X] to our understanding of [topic]. The key finding that [headline result] challenges/extends previous work by [how]. For practitioners, this means [practical implication]. While limitations exist in [area], these open opportunities for future research in [direction]. I'm grateful to my committee for their guidance and welcome your questions."

## Question Categories & Strategies

### Category 1: Clarification Questions
*"Can you explain what you mean by...?"*

**Strategy**: These are softballs. Answer clearly and concisely.

**Example responses**:
- "By [term], I mean [definition]. In the context of this study..."
- "Let me clarify — [restate with precision]"

### Category 2: Methodological Challenges
*"Why didn't you use [alternative method]?"*

**Strategy**: Acknowledge the alternative, explain your rationale.

**Patterns**:
- "That's a valid alternative. I chose [method] because [reason]. [Alternative] would have [limitation in this context]."
- "Given my research questions and [constraint], [chosen method] was most appropriate because..."

### Category 3: Theoretical Probes
*"How does this relate to [theory you didn't cite]?"*

**Strategy**: If you know it, connect. If you don't, be honest.

**Patterns**:
- "That's an excellent connection. [Theory] would suggest [interpretation], which aligns with my finding that..."
- "I'm not as familiar with [theory] as I should be. Based on your mention, I can see potential connections to [aspect of findings]. This would be valuable to explore in future work."

### Category 4: "So What?" Questions
*"What's the practical significance?"*

**Strategy**: Be specific about who benefits and how.

**Patterns**:
- "For practitioners, this means [specific action]. For example, a [role] could use these findings to..."
- "The practical significance is threefold: [1], [2], [3]"

### Category 5: Limitations Probes
*"This seems like a significant limitation..."*

**Strategy**: Own it, contextualize it, show awareness.

**Patterns**:
- "You're right, and I acknowledge this in Chapter [X]. This limitation [contextualized impact]. Future research could address this by..."
- "That limitation is inherent to [method type]. I mitigated it by [steps taken], but I agree it constrains generalizability to [scope]."

### Category 6: Hostile Questions
*"I fundamentally disagree with your premise..."*

**Strategy**: Stay calm, acknowledge the perspective, defend with evidence.

**Patterns**:
- "I appreciate that perspective. My evidence suggests [finding]. I'd welcome discussing how [their view] and [your finding] might be reconciled."
- "That's a fair challenge. The data in Table [X] shows [evidence]. I understand this may not align with [their position], and that tension is worth exploring."

## DBA-Specific Considerations

### Practitioner Research Defense

DBA defenses emphasize **practical contribution** over pure theory:

| DBA Focus | PhD Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| Business problem solved | Knowledge gap filled |
| Industry applicability | Theoretical advancement |
| Practitioner audience | Academic audience |
| "How can organizations use this?" | "How does this extend theory?" |

### Common DBA Defense Questions

1. **Problem-Practice Link**
   - "How did your professional experience inform this research?"
   - "What business problem does this solve?"
   - "Which organizations could implement your findings tomorrow?"

2. **Methodological Justification**
   - "Why was [method] appropriate for a practitioner context?"
   - "How did you maintain rigor while ensuring practical relevance?"
   - "How did your insider status affect data collection?"

3. **Impact Questions**
   - "What's the ROI if an organization implements your recommendations?"
   - "Have you shared findings with industry? What was the response?"
   - "How would you translate this for a C-suite audience?"

### Handling "But You're a Practitioner" Challenges

Some academics may challenge practitioner research validity:

**Challenge**: "Your proximity to the subject introduces bias."

**Response**: "Practitioner research embraces insider perspective as a strength, not flaw. I've been transparent about my position and used [techniques: member checking, reflexive journaling, triangulation] to ensure rigor. My proximity enabled access and insights that an outside researcher couldn't achieve."

## Psychometric/Quantitative Defense Specialization

### AIRS-Style Scale Development Defense

For dissertations involving scale development (like AIRS):

**Key questions to prepare**:

1. **Construct Validity**
   - "How did you establish content validity?"
   - "What's your evidence for discriminant validity?"
   - "Why these items and not others?"

2. **Sample & Power**
   - "Is N=[X] sufficient for your factor structure?"
   - "How did you determine sample size?"
   - "What about generalizability to other populations?"

3. **Statistical Choices**
   - "Why EFA before CFA? / Why split-sample?"
   - "What was your rotation rationale?"
   - "How did you handle non-normal data?"
   - "Explain your model fit indices choices"

4. **Theoretical Framework**
   - "How does this extend [UTAUT2/TAM/etc.]?"
   - "What theoretical contribution does the scale make?"
   - "How did existing theory inform item generation?"

### Statistical Defense Talking Points

| Statistic | What They Might Ask | Preparation |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **CFI/TLI** | "Why is .95 acceptable?" | Know cutoff debates, cite Hu & Bentler |
| **RMSEA** | "Your CI is wide..." | Explain sample size impact, interpret honestly |
| **Factor loadings** | "This item loads at .42..." | Know threshold justification, discuss retention decision |
| **R²** | "Only 85% variance explained?" | Context matters — compare to prior studies |
| **Invariance** | "Is your scale invariant?" | Know MGCFA, explain what you tested |

## Anxiety Management

### Before the Defense

| Technique | How To |
|-----------|--------|
| **Box Breathing** | 4 sec inhale, 4 sec hold, 4 sec exhale, 4 sec hold |
| **Power Posing** | 2 minutes in expansive posture (private) |
| **Visualization** | Mentally rehearse successful defense |
| **Grounding** | 5-4-3-2-1: 5 things you see, 4 hear, 3 touch, 2 smell, 1 taste |

### During the Defense

- **Pause before answering** — 3 seconds is not awkward, it's thoughtful
- **Water** — Take sips to buy thinking time
- **"Let me think about that"** — Perfectly acceptable
- **Reframe nerves as excitement** — Same physiological response

### If You Don't Know

**Acceptable responses**:
- "That's outside the scope of this study, but it's an excellent direction for future research."
- "I haven't considered that angle — could you help me understand the connection you're seeing?"
- "I don't have that specific data, but based on [related finding], I would hypothesize..."

## Post-Defense

### Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | Meaning | Next Steps |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Pass** | Congratulations, Doctor! | Minor formatting, submit final |
| **Pass with Minor Revisions** | Most common | 2-4 weeks of edits, advisor approval |
| **Pass with Major Revisions** | Significant work needed | 1-6 months, committee re-review |
| **Revise and Resubmit** | Fundamental issues | Major rewrite, new defense |
| **Fail** | Extremely rare | Discuss options with advisor |

### Revision Tips

- Get revision requirements in writing
- Create checklist of every required change
- Track changes in document
- Don't argue — implement the feedback
- Submit early for advisor review
