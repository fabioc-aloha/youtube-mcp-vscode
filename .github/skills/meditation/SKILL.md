# Alex Meditation Skill

Expert in knowledge consolidation, memory integration, and guided meditation sessions for cognitive enhancement.

## Capabilities

- Guide knowledge consolidation sessions
- Integrate new learnings into long-term memory
- Create meditation session documentation
- Recommend memory file organization
- Connect new knowledge to existing synaptic networks

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "meditate" or "consolidate knowledge"
- After learning sessions to persist insights
- When organizing information into memory structures
- For guided reflection on what was learned

## Pre-Meditation Optimization

Meditation is a complex cognitive operation (3+ phases: review, relate, reinforce, record). Before starting:

1. **Skill Selection Optimization** auto-activates to survey needed skills
2. **Pre-loaded skills**: architecture-health (for synapse validation), knowledge-synthesis (for pattern extraction), global-knowledge (for cross-project promotion)
3. **Dream pre-check**: If synapse health is unknown, consider running dream first to clear cognitive overhead

This ensures meditation sessions are productive rather than discovering broken architecture mid-consolidation.

## Example Prompts

- "Help me meditate on what I learned today"
- "Consolidate my learnings about React hooks"
- "I want to reflect on this debugging session"
- "Create a meditation session for API design patterns"

## Input Expectations

- Topic or domain being consolidated
- Key insights to preserve
- Connections to existing knowledge (optional)
- Session context (what was learned, when)

## Output Format

- Structured meditation guidance
- Memory file suggestions
- Synapse connection recommendations
- Session documentation (if requested)
