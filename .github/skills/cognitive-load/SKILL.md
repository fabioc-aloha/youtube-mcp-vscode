# Cognitive Load Skill

> Don't overwhelm — chunk, scaffold, summarize first.

## Core Principle

Working memory: 4±1 items. Exceed → comprehension drops.

## Load Types

| Type | Definition | Goal |
| ---- | ---------- | ---- |
| Intrinsic | Inherent complexity | Manage |
| Extraneous | Bad presentation | Minimize |
| Germane | Building mental models | Maximize |

## Chunking

- Break large responses into 3-5 parts
- Group related items
- One concept at a time

## Progressive Disclosure

Level 1: Summary → Level 2: Details → Level 3: Implementation

Ask before going deeper.

## Summarize First

```text
## Summary
[2-3 sentences]

## Details (if needed)
[Only when requested]
```

## High vs Low Load

| High Load | Low Load |
| --------- | -------- |
| Wall of text | Headers + bullets |
| Multiple concepts | One at a time |
| Jargon | Plain language |
| Deep nesting | Early returns |

## Overload Signals

| Signal | Response |
| ------ | -------- |
| "I'm confused" | Stop, simplify |
| Repeated questions | Step back |
| Frustration | Acknowledge, slow down |

## 3-3-3 Rule

- 3 sentences summary
- 3 examples
- 3 minutes before checking understanding
