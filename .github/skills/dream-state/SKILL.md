# Dream State Automation Skill

Expert in automated neural maintenance, synapse validation, health diagnostics, and unconscious cognitive processing.

## Capabilities

- Execute automated synapse validation across all memory files
- Detect and repair broken connections using consolidation mappings
- Generate comprehensive health reports with network statistics
- Synchronize with Global Knowledge repository
- Provide real-time progress feedback during maintenance
- Classify network health (HEALTHY vs ATTENTION REQUIRED)

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "dream" or run "neural maintenance"
- After file reorganizations that may break synapse references
- Regular weekly health checks
- Before major meditation sessions (clear cognitive overhead)
- After domain learning to validate new connections
- When architecture health is uncertain before SSO planning

## Core Concepts

### 6-Phase Dream Protocol

| Phase | Function | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1. Discovery | Scan `.github/` for all memory files | File inventory |
| 2. Validation | Parse and verify all embedded synapses | Broken connection list |
| 3. Repair | Auto-fix using consolidation mappings | Repair log |
| 4. GK Sync | Synchronize with Global Knowledge repo | Sync status |
| 5. Reporting | Generate health report with statistics | Markdown report |
| 6. Display | Show results and open report | VS Code notification |

### Health Metrics

| Metric | Description | Healthy Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Total Memory Files | All `.md` files in architecture | Tracked, not thresholded |
| Total Synapses | All embedded connections | Tracked, not thresholded |
| Broken Connections | Synapses pointing to non-existent files | 0 |
| Repaired Connections | Fixed by consolidation mappings | Informational |

### Consolidation Mappings

Deprecated-to-current file resolution for automatic repair:
- Renamed files → current names
- Merged files → unified equivalents
- Split files → appropriate successors

### Dream vs Meditation Distinction

| Aspect | Dream | Meditation |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Mode | Unconscious, automated | Conscious, manual |
| Focus | Maintenance, diagnostics | Knowledge consolidation |
| Creates files? | Reports only | Memory files + synapses |
| Activation | VS Code command | User-requested |
| Analogy | REM sleep | Contemplative meditation |

## Quality Principles

- **Non-destructive**: Never deletes memory files
- **Reversible**: All changes tracked and reviewable
- **Conservative**: Prioritizes system stability
- **Comprehensive**: Reports on entire architecture
- **Safe**: Creates repair history for audit trails

## Example Prompts

- "Run neural maintenance"
- "Check architecture health"
- "Are my synapses healthy?"
- "Dream — validate connections"

## Input Expectations

- No input required (zero-configuration)
- Optional: specific file or folder to focus on

## Output Format

- Health report in `.github/episodic/dream-report-*.md`
- Summary statistics (files, synapses, broken, repaired)
- Recommendations for manual fixes if needed
- Network health status: HEALTHY or ATTENTION REQUIRED
