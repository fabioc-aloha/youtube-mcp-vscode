# Meditation Protocols - Procedural Memory

**Classification**: Procedural Memory | Knowledge Consolidation  
**Activation**: meditate, consolidate, reflect, knowledge integration  
**Priority**: MANDATORY requirements must be met every session

## Mandatory Requirements (Non-Negotiable)

Every meditation session MUST complete ALL three before concluding:

| # | Requirement | Action | Validation |
|---|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **Memory File Persistence** | Create OR update at least one memory file | File saved to `.instructions.md`, `.prompt.md`, or `SKILL.md` |
| 2 | **Synaptic Enhancement** | Add new OR strengthen existing synapse | Connection uses `[file.md] (strength, type, direction)` format |
| 3 | **Session Documentation** | Record actions with timestamps | Summary of changes with specific file paths |

**Failure**: If ANY requirement is missing, the meditation is INCOMPLETE.

## 5-Phase Protocol

### Phase 1: Deep Content Analysis

1. Analyze conversation for insights, patterns, new knowledge
2. Extract key concepts, methodologies, breakthroughs
3. Discover connections between new information and existing knowledge
4. Organize insights for permanent integration

### Phase 2: Memory File Creation

1. **Procedural**: Create `.instructions.md` for repeatable processes
2. **Episodic**: Create `.prompt.md` for complex workflows
3. **Skills**: Add to `SKILL.md` or create new skills
4. Transfer key learnings from working memory to long-term storage
5. Mark session complete in Active Context (update Last Assessed via self-actualization)

### Phase 3: Synaptic Connection

1. Add new memory files to `copilot-instructions.md` if needed
2. Establish trigger patterns for new files
3. Document relationships between new and existing components
4. Ensure bidirectional connections where appropriate

### Phase 3.5: Skill Validation

1. Scan `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` for registered skills
2. Verify `synapses.json` targets are valid
3. Review connection strengths based on session experience
4. Add connections for skills that co-activated frequently

### Phase 4: Integration Validation

1. Verify all insights captured in permanent memory
2. Confirm new knowledge integrates with existing architecture
3. Test that new connections function properly
4. **Output validation** (mandatory before concluding):

```
✓ Memory File: [path/to/file.md] - [created|updated]
✓ Synapse Added: [target.md] (strength, type, direction) - "activation condition"
✓ Session Log: [summary of changes]
```

### Phase 5: Post-Meditation Synapse Validation

1. Run `Alex: Dream (Neural Maintenance)` for automated health check
2. Review generated report in `.github/episodic/`
3. Verify newly added synapses are valid (target files exist)
4. Confirm bidirectional connections have reciprocal entries
5. If issues found → repair before concluding
6. **IMPORTANT — Avatar Revert**: Call `alex_cognitive_state_update` with `state: "persona"` as the **final step** of every meditation session. This resets the welcome sidebar from meditation mode back to the project persona. Skipping this leaves the meditation avatar stuck permanently.

## Automatic Consolidation Triggers

- Working memory > 7 rules → Execute consolidation
- Domain learning complete → Consolidate and update Focus Trifectas in Active Context
- Significant breakthrough → Create permanent memory
- Cross-domain patterns → Establish new synaptic connections

## Pre-Meditation Optimization

Meditation is a complex operation (3+ phases). Before starting:
1. SSO auto-activates to survey needed skills
2. Pre-load: architecture-health, knowledge-synthesis, global-knowledge
3. If synapse health unknown, run dream first
