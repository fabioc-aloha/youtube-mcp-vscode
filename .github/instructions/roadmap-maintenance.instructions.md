# Roadmap Maintenance Procedural Memory

**Classification**: Procedural Memory | Documentation Quality  
**Activation**: roadmap update, backlog audit, research findings, version planning  
**Priority**: HIGH - Prevents roadmap drift and duplication

---

## Synapses

- [ROADMAP-UNIFIED.md] → (Critical, Documentation, Source-of-Truth) - "Product roadmap requiring active maintenance"
- [.github/instructions/release-management.instructions.md] → (High, Coordinates, Bidirectional) - "Version shipping updates roadmap status"
- [.github/instructions/research-first-workflow.instructions.md] → (Medium, Feeds, Forward) - "Research outputs should integrate with roadmap"
- [.github/instructions/technical-debt-tracking.instructions.md] → (Medium, References, Bidirectional) - "Debt items may appear in backlog"
- [.github/instructions/meditation.instructions.md] → (Medium, Triggers, Bidirectional) - "Session learnings may inform roadmap priorities"

---

## Roadmap Hygiene Discipline

### Principle

The roadmap is a **living document** that requires active curation to prevent:
- **Duplication** — Items appearing in both "Research Findings" and scheduled versions
- **Drift** — Backlog items already implemented but not removed
- **Ambiguity** — Similar items listed separately instead of combined
- **Staleness** — Completed research not promoted to scheduled work

---

## Mandatory Maintenance Triggers

| Trigger | Action | Frequency |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Version shipped | Update Version Status table (📋 Planned → ✅ Shipped) | Every release |
| Research complete | Move from Research Findings → scheduled version OR remove if obsolete | When research concludes |
| New feature added | Check if already in backlog/research before adding | Before roadmap edit |
| Backlog item proposed | Verify not already scheduled in Version Details | Before adding to backlog |
| Similar features found | Combine into single entry with comprehensive scope | During backlog audit |

---

## Backlog Audit Procedure

**When to Audit**: Quarterly, before major releases, or when backlog > 20 items

### Step 1: Deduplication

1. **Cross-reference Research Findings vs Version Details**
   - Remove research items already scheduled (e.g., VS Code 1.109 in v5.9.0)
   - Remove research items already shipped (e.g., Architecture assessment completed)
2. **Cross-reference Backlog vs Version Details**
   - Remove backlog items already scheduled in a version
   - Promote high-priority backlog items to scheduled versions
3. **Cross-reference Research vs Backlog**
   - Consolidate overlapping items (choose most specific location)

### Step 2: Consolidation

1. **Identify Similar Items**
   - Group by domain (e.g., "Marp presentation" + "PptxGenJS integration" → "Presentation automation")
   - Combine items with shared implementation (e.g., "DALL-E" redundant if "Replicate" exists)
2. **Merge Related Entries**
   - Keep most comprehensive description
   - Add "Combines: X, Y, Z" note if helpful
   - Update priority/effort to reflect combined scope

### Step 3: Verification

1. **Check Implementation Status**
   - Search codebase for feature evidence (grep, file_search)
   - If implemented: Remove from backlog OR update status to "✅ Shipped"
2. **Update Completion Ratios**
   - For partial work, use "X/Y complete" format (e.g., "28/32 GK patterns migrated")
   - Avoids binary incomplete/complete, shows progress

### Step 4: Prioritization

1. **Re-evaluate P0/P1/P2** based on:
   - Current roadmap focus (e.g., v5.7.x = UI/UX, not new platforms)
   - Dependency chains (feature X blocks feature Y)
   - User impact vs effort ratio
2. **Archive Low-Priority Items**
   - Move P3+ items to `archive/roadmaps/backlog-archive-YYYY-MM.md`
   - Keeps active backlog focused and actionable

## Research Findings Management

### Purpose

Research Findings captures **exploratory work** that may or may not become scheduled features.

### Lifecycle

```
Research Started → Research Findings (unscheduled)
                ↓
        Research Complete
                ↓
        ┌───────┴───────┐
        ↓               ↓
   Scheduled Work   Not Viable
   (move to vX.X)   (remove entry)
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Duplication** — Item in both Research Findings AND scheduled version  
❌ **Permanent Residence** — Research item never promoted or removed  
❌ **Implementation Drift** — Feature implemented but Research Findings not updated  
❌ **Vague Entries** — "Explore X" without timeline or outcome criteria

### Best Practices

✅ **Time-Boxing** — Add target date or version for research completion  
✅ **Outcome Criteria** — "Decide: viable heir platform vs out of scope" (clear exit)  
✅ **Promotion Path** — When research concludes, schedule OR remove (don't leave in limbo)  
✅ **Status Tracking** — Use "🔬 Researching" / "✅ Complete" / "❌ Not Viable" markers

## Version Status Updates

### When Version Ships

1. **Update Version Status Table**
   ```markdown
   | v5.7.5 | Skill Intelligence | Context-Aware Guidance | 📋 Planned |
   ```
   becomes:
   ```markdown
   | **v5.7.5** | **Skill Intelligence** | **Context-Aware Guidance** | **✅ Shipped** |
   ```

2. **Update Task Status in Version Details**
   - All tasks: 📋 → ✅ (if complete)
   - OR update individual task status if partially complete

---

## Three-State Status Vocabulary

Binary status (`Planned` / `Shipped`) misses the most common real-world state: **work is complete but not yet published or released**. Use three states to avoid roadmaps that lie.

| Status | Emoji | Meaning |
|--------|:-----:|---------|
| In scaffold | 📋 | Structure exists; substantive logic not yet written |
| Implemented | 🔨 | Real code written and logically complete; not yet compiled/tested/published |
| Shipped | ✅ | Compiled, tested, and published to users |

**Why the middle state matters**: A roadmap that jumps from `📋 In scaffold` to `✅ Shipped` creates a false picture during the implementation phase — where most time is actually spent. A feature that's 80% to ship looks identical to one that's 0% to ship without `🔨 Implemented`.

### Application Rule

When auditing a roadmap item:
1. Does a `src/` or equivalent exist with real logic (not just boilerplate)? → `🔨 Implemented`
2. Has it passed compile, test, and been published to users? → `✅ Shipped`
3. Neither? → `📋 In scaffold`

For extension-specific roadmaps, "Implemented" means `extension.ts` has real command registrations and logic. "Shipped" means `npx vsce publish` has run successfully.

3. **Update Current State Section**
   - Bump version number (e.g., "v5.7.2 is current" → "v5.7.5 is current")
   - Add shipped features to capabilities list

---

## Integration with Release Management

**Timing**: Roadmap updates happen during release workflow

1. **Pre-Release**: Version Details tasks marked ✅ as completed
2. **At Release**: Version Status updated to Shipped
3. **Post-Release**: Current State section updated with new capabilities
4. **Next Cycle**: Backlog audit to plan next version

**See Also**: [release-management.instructions.md] for full release workflow

## Example: February 15, 2026 Session Audit

**Issue**: Research Findings accumulated duplicates with scheduled roadmap

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Removed from Research Findings** (already scheduled):
   - VS Code 1.109 → already in v5.9.0
   - Architecture assessment → already completed
   - @alex enhancement → already in v5.8.x
2. **Removed from Research Findings** (already implemented):
   - DALL-E → Replicate MCP already integrated
3. **Combined Similar Items**:
   - "Marp presentation tool" + "PptxGenJS automation" → "Presentation automation (Marp + PptxGenJS + Replicate)"
4. **Updated Partial Completion**:
   - "GK pattern format inconsistency" → "GK pattern format migration (28/32 complete in v5.6.5) — P2"

**Result**: Research Findings reduced from 12 items → 8 items (33% reduction), zero duplication

## Validation Checklist

Before committing roadmap changes:

- [ ] No item appears in multiple sections (Research Findings, Backlog, Scheduled Version)
- [ ] All completed items removed or marked ✅ Shipped
- [ ] Similar items combined with rationale noted
- [ ] Partial completion uses "X/Y" ratio format
- [ ] Version Status table reflects latest ships
- [ ] Current State section updated if version shipped
- [ ] All Research Findings have outcome criteria or target version
