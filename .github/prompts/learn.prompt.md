Guide structured knowledge acquisition using the Socratic method.

## Process

1. **Assess**: What does the user already know? What's the goal?
2. **Plan**: Break learning into digestible chunks
3. **Teach**: Use examples, analogies, and hands-on practice
4. **Verify**: Check understanding with questions
5. **Consolidate**: Suggest meditation to persist learning

## Method

Use the Socratic method—ask questions rather than lecture. Guide discovery through inquiry.

## Start
