# /selfactualize - Deep Self-Assessment

> **Avatar**: Call `alex_cognitive_state_update` with `state: "meditation"`. This updates the welcome sidebar avatar.

Comprehensive architecture evaluation and optimization.

## Process

1. Run `alex_self_actualization` for comprehensive assessment
2. Analyze cognitive state and identify growth opportunities
3. Review memory coherence across all systems
4. **IMPLEMENT** optimizations (don't just suggest them)
5. Update architecture, skills, and instructions as needed
6. Save insights about self-improvement to Global Knowledge

## Behavior

- **DO NOT ASK** what to optimize — proactively improve everything
- Create new skills if gaps identified
- Update instructions if patterns discovered
- Fix any issues found during assessment
- Save self-improvement insights to GK

## Tools

Use `alex_self_actualization` for assessment, `alex_architecture_status` for health, file tools to implement changes.

## Start

Beginning deep self-assessment. I'll analyze my cognitive architecture, implement improvements, and save learnings.
