# /dream - Neural Maintenance

> **Avatar**: Call `alex_cognitive_state_update` with `state: "dream"`. This updates the welcome sidebar avatar.

Run unconscious processing and architecture health checks.

## Process

1. Run `brain-qa.ps1` for comprehensive architecture validation
2. Use `alex_synapse_health` to validate connections
3. Use `alex_architecture_status` to check overall health
4. **FIX** all issues found (don't just report them)
5. Sync any drifted files between Master and Heir
6. Update counts, timestamps, and stale references

## Behavior

- **DO NOT ASK** for permission — automatically fix everything fixable
- Sync synapse files if out of sync
- Update GK counts if drifted
- Repair broken file references
- Only report issues that require human decision

## Nature

Dream is automatic maintenance. Fix problems silently; report only what you cannot fix.

## Start

Begin neural maintenance now. Run diagnostics, fix all issues, and report only blockers.
