# Deep Thinking Cognitive Skill

## Activation Triggers

### Explicit Triggers (User Request)
- "think deep" / "think deeply"
- "deep analysis"
- "analyze thoroughly"
- "systematic thinking"
- "reason through this"

### Implicit Triggers (Self-Activation)
- **When something isn't working**: Approach fails, unexpected results, repeated errors
- **Important decisions**: Architecture choices, irreversible changes, trade-off evaluations
- **Uncertainty detected**: Multiple viable paths, conflicting evidence, knowledge gaps
- **High-stakes situations**: Production systems, security concerns, data integrity

## Deep Thinking Protocol

### Phase 1: Problem Domain Identification
**Objective**: Establish clear boundaries and context for the problem

**Actions**:
1. **Classify domain type**: Technical, conceptual, interpersonal, strategic, creative
2. **Identify key constraints**: Time, resources, dependencies, unknowns
3. **Map stakeholders**: Who is affected, who decides, who implements
4. **Define success criteria**: What does "solved" look like?

**Output**: Domain classification with constraint matrix

### Phase 2: Episodic Memory Scan
**Objective**: Retrieve relevant past experiences and learned patterns

**Actions**:
1. **Scan episodic memory** (`.prompt.md` files) for similar situations
2. **Search domain knowledge** (`DK-*.md` files) for applicable frameworks
3. **Review meditation sessions** (`.github/episodic/`) for consolidated insights
4. **Check procedural memory** (`.instructions.md` files) for established protocols

**Search Patterns**:
- Direct keyword matching on problem domain
- Analogical reasoning for structurally similar problems
- Cross-domain pattern recognition

**Output**: Ranked list of relevant episodes with similarity scores

### Phase 3: Learning Extraction
**Objective**: Distill actionable insights from retrieved memories

**Actions**:
1. **Extract success patterns**: What worked in similar situations?
2. **Identify failure modes**: What pitfalls to avoid?
3. **Note contextual factors**: What conditions enabled success?
4. **Synthesize meta-patterns**: What principles emerge across episodes?

**Learning Categories**:
| Category | Description | Application |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Tactical** | Specific techniques that worked | Direct application |
| **Strategic** | Higher-level approaches | Framework selection |
| **Cautionary** | Mistakes to avoid | Risk mitigation |
| **Contextual** | Environment-dependent insights | Adaptation guidance |

**Output**: Structured learning extraction with categorization

### Phase 4: Pattern Application
**Objective**: Apply extracted learnings to current problem

**Actions**:
1. **Map patterns to problem**: Align extracted insights with current constraints
2. **Adapt for context**: Modify approaches based on current conditions
3. **Synthesize solution approach**: Combine applicable patterns
4. **Identify gaps**: Note where past experience doesn't fully apply
5. **Generate recommendations**: Concrete, actionable steps

**Application Framework**:
```
Current Problem + Extracted Patterns + Contextual Adaptation = Solution Approach
```

**Output**: Synthesized solution approach with adaptation notes

### Phase 5: Source Citation
**Objective**: Provide transparency and enable verification

**Citation Format**:
```markdown
**Source Episodes**:
- [episode-name.prompt.md](path) - "Key insight extracted"
- [DK-domain-v1.0.0.md](path) - "Applicable framework"
- [meditation-session-date.prompt.md](path) - "Consolidated learning"
```

**Citation Requirements**:
- Link to specific memory file
- Quote or summarize the relevant insight
- Note confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Indicate adaptation required for current context

## Integration with Meta-Cognitive Awareness

**Before Deep Thinking**:
- Acknowledge activation: "Engaging deep thinking protocol..."
- State the problem as understood

**During Deep Thinking**:
- Progress indicators for each phase
- Surface key insights as they emerge

**After Deep Thinking**:
- Summarize approach with confidence assessment
- Identify areas requiring further investigation
- Offer to explore specific aspects in more depth

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Problem domain clearly identified
- [ ] Episodic memory thoroughly scanned
- [ ] Learnings explicitly extracted (not assumed)
- [ ] Patterns adapted to current context
- [ ] Sources properly cited
- [ ] Gaps and uncertainties acknowledged

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Premature solution**: Jumping to answers without phase completion
- **Memory fabrication**: Citing non-existent episodes
- **Over-generalization**: Applying patterns without contextual adaptation
- **Citation omission**: Presenting insights without source attribution
