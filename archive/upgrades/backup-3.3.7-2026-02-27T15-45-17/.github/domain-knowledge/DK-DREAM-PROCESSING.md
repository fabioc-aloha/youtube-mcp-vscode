## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Dual-Mode Cognitive Processing

**Unconscious Mode (VS Code Extension Automation)**:
- Automated maintenance and health monitoring
- Standardized diagnostic reporting and archival
- Orphan file detection and network topology analysis
- Scheduled maintenance without conscious intervention

**Conscious Mode (AI-Driven Enhancement)**:
- Intelligent pattern analysis beyond basic detection
- Dynamic memory file enhancement and creation

- Real-time knowledge consolidation and integration

**Lucid Mode (Hybrid Bridge)**:
- Automated detection triggers intelligent enhancement
- Extension identifies opportunities, AI implements improvements
- Bridge between unconscious maintenance and conscious optimization
- Optimal cognitive architecture evolution through integrated processing

### Post-Dream Enhancement Principle

Dream sessions identify optimization opportunities and generate diagnostic reports, but **actual cognitive improvements require systematic enhancement of memory files and synaptic networks** following dream analysis.
